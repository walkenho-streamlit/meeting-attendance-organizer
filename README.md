# MAOrganizer - Meeting Attendance Organizer

An app to organize meeting attendants.

Currently planned functionality:

* Split a list of attendants into first and lastnames.
* Given a substring (for example first or last name), find all attendants in the list whose name includes this substring.
* Given two attendance lists, produces a list of newly added attendants.
