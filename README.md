# 📅 Meeting Attendance Organizer

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://meeting-attendance-organizer.streamlit.app/)

This app fullfills a simple need: It lets users upload one or more lists of names of people attending a meeting and performs the following tasks:

* ✂️ Split attendee names into first name and surname.
* 👀 Compare two lists of attendees with each other and see who is new on the second list.
* 🔎 Find people in a list by either searching for their complete names or parts of their name
* 💾 Write any of the results back out, so you can share it with others.

You can find it deployed under https://meeting-attendance-organizer.streamlit.app/.

Note, that whilst this repository is the app's development repository, it is deployed from [my Streamlit Deployment repository](https://github.com/walkenho-streamlit). You can find [more information on why I won't deploy Streamlit applications from my main Github account](https://walkenho.github.io/excuse-me-streamlit-cloud-you-want-what/) on my blog.

For more information why I built the meeting-organizer-app in the first place, see [Why and How I built an App to Help Me Organize London's PyData Meetup](https://walkenho.github.io/building-a-meeting-organizer-app-with-streamlit/).
